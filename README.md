# yapi : Databases project implement the youtube api
this is a project made by Touama Youssef / Laaouini anas.
to run this project you must have a server with a web server software as apache installed in it, or you can  easily use xampp wich is a free and open-source cross-platform web server providing the apache software in it.

after you install it on your computer, follow those steps :
## clone this project into your htdocs folder
```sh
git clone https://github.com/17Pixelz/project.git
```

## open the site
open the site and an interface will show up asking you for a username, password, and a database name; don't panic, you just need to fill them with your database username and your password of that username and the name that you'll give to your db.

## start filling and submitting
now you're ready to go, just type a keyword and a date range and click "chercher" and let it roll over.
The data will be stored into your database and you can navigate it from the bar at the top.
